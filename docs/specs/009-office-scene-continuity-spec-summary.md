# Implementation summary — Office scene continuity

- **Parent spec:** [`009-office-scene-continuity-spec.md`](009-office-scene-continuity-spec.md)
- **Implemented at:** 2026-08-12
- **Implementation status:** Delivered

## Delivered

- Added road-style separators in the existing horizontal and vertical room
  gaps. The responsive room rectangles, natural-width packing, and configured
  alignment modes remain unchanged.
- Nudged reception table artwork four pixels inward so stations at the CEO
  Office edge retain clear boundary space.
- Added a rear bar shelf with drinks and replaced the fixed foreground drink
  set with one aligned glass per visible Agent Bar agent. Bounded or omitted
  agents do not create extra graphics.

## Evidence

- `npm run lint:web` passed.
- `npm run test:web -- --run` passed: 50 files / 345 tests.
- `npm run build:web` passed with the existing Vite large-chunk warning.
- Manual live checks passed at 1440×900 and 1920×1200: room roads render
  behind the packed rows, reception furniture stays inside the CEO area, and
  Agent Bar glasses follow visible agent occupancy.

## Constraints

- No Herdr, bridge, persistence, or protocol changes were made.
- Mobile-specific composition and richer agent-specific drink types remain
  deferred.
